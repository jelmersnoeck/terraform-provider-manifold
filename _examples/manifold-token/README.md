# Manifold Token

This example will show you how to use the Manifold Terraform Provider to create
a new token you can use to connect to Manifold.

This is useful when you want to create more fine-grained tokens to access
different resources.

## Used resources

- `manifold.resource.manifold_api_token`

## Prerequisites

To use this resource, you need to create an API token which has admin access.
